# Barista-App

The goal was to build an APP that allowed a local coffee shop to place orders onto an app and have the barista mark it completed.

## How It's Made:

## Tech Used: HTML , CSS , JS , Node, MongoDB , Express

This project combines a simple layout built out with HTML & CSS with JS and Node/MongoDB as it's backbone. Orders are stored on a MongoDB database and retrieved using node.

## Lessons Learned

This project tested my ability to retrieve information from a database and display it on the DOM.
